This is my professional portfolio. The website consists few of my course projects, previous experience and about me. I have use HTM, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap for building this web page. I have used Git pages to deploy my project code.

Steps followed to Deploy:
Created a repository and committing the files, I’ve just went to repo settings -> pages -> sources and in sources I have selected the branch to be main and save. This gave me the deployed site by git.

Commands used to make commits to my git:
~ $ git remote add origin git@github.com:PendyalaLasya/PendyalaLasya.github.io
~ $ git add .
~ $ git commit -m “Initial commit”
~ $ git push  

Instructions to run the code:
Any outside user can directly pull the repo or can also download .zip. If .zip is downloaded the user can extract the files and add to any code editors to edit or can just open .html file on the browser to run the code.
